to.\nIn summary, this paper introduces a scene of future that every objects will be connected into the internet and clouds will connect with each other to share the data of all the hardware around us. \nIn the second part, it introduces the ubiquitous computing in the next decade. It introduces a novel integrated sensor-actuator-internet framework and it predicted that this framework would be the core technology of shaping a smart environment. As we moved from web to web2.0 to web3.0, the need for data-on-demand using sophisticated queries increases, so it is necessary to deploy a large-scale wireless sensor network infrastructure that includes data management and processing, actuation and analytics.\nIn the third part, it introduces some definitions, trends and elements. Internet of Things is realized in three paradigms, middleware, sensors, and knowledge. It had been forecasted that IoT would take 5-10 years for market adoption. The whole development of technologies are shown in figure 2 and figure 3. We can clearly see the sequence of emerging technologies from human augmentation to preictive analytics. \nIn the fourth part, it introduces several application domains which will be impacted by the emerging internet of things. They categorize the application into 4 domains: Personal and Home, Enterprize, Utilities, Mobile. \nIn the fifth part, it introduces a cloud centric internet of things. The aneka cloud computing platform is a .NET-based application development Platform-as-a-Service(PaaS), which can utilize storage and compute resources of both public and private clouds.\nIn the sixth part, it introduces IoT sensor data analytics SaaS using Aneka and Microsoft Azure. Microsoft Azure is a cloud platform, offered by Microsoft, includes four components, SQL Azure, AppFabric, Azure Martketplace. There are several advantages of combing them. Aneka can overcomes the interoperability issues by providing a framework, which enables the creation of adaptors for different cloud infrastructures. Another important features is SaaS to be updated by the developers dynamically. Management extensibility framework (MEF) provides a simple solution to this problem. The MEF can improves the flexibility, maintainability and testability of large applications.\nIn summary, this paper was published in 2013, but had depicted the lifestyle that we are not living. I think we haven't been such a intelligent lifestyle but we are approaching. \n"},"A Taxonomy of Mixed Reality Visual Display.html":{"url":"A Taxonomy of Mixed Reality Visual Display.html","title":"A Taxonomy of Mixed Reality Visual Display","keywords":"","body":""},"Making epistemological trouble Third-paradigm HCI as successor science.html":{"url":"Making epistemological trouble Third-paradigm HCI as successor science.html","title":"Making epistemological trouble: Third-paradigm HCI as successor science","keywords":"","body":""},"The Sense of Embodiment in Virtual Reality.html":{"url":"The Sense of Embodiment in Virtual Reality.html","title":"The Sense of Embodiment in Virtual Reality","keywords":"","body":""},"Tangible Bits Beyond Pixels.html":{"url":"Tangible Bits Beyond Pixels.html","title":"Tangible Bits: Beyond Pixels","keywords":"","body":""},"Mapping Machine Learning Advances.html":{"url":"Mapping Machine Learning Advances.html","title":"Mapping Machine Learning Advances","keywords":"","body":""}}}
